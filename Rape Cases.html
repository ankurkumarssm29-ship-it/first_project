<p><b><u>Key Facts from the 2025 Projections</u></b></p>
<p><b>Total Projected Cases:</b> An estimated 26,337 rape cases are projected to be registered across India 2025.</p>

<p><b>Top Regions:</b> Rajasthan leads with 5,600 projected cases, followed by Uttar Pradesh (4,000), Madhya Pradesh (3,100), Maharashtra (2,950), and Haryana (1,900). These states account for nearly half of the total cases, reflecting their large populations and systemic issues.</p>

<p><b>Lowest Numbers:</b> Union territories like Lakshadweep (3 cases), Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (6 cases), and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (8 cases) report the fewest cases, likely due to smaller populations.</p>

<p><b>Data Gaps:</b> West Bengal and Ladakh have no available data (“N/A”) due to incomplete or non-submitted statistics in recent NCRB reports, particularly West Bengal’s non-submission in 2022 and Ladakh’s limited reporting capacity.</p>
<p><b><u>Reasons for the Absence of Data in Certain Regions</u></b></p>
<p>The lack of data for West Bengal and Ladakh arises from different challenges:</p>

<p><b>West Bengal:</b> The state has historically been criticized for its inconsistent reporting to the NCRB, having submitted no data for the year 2022. Various political and administrative factors may play a role in this discrepancy, rendering projections unreliable.</p>

<p><b>Ladakh:</b> Being a newly established union territory, Ladakh does not possess a comprehensive crime reporting system, and its sparse population along with its remote location may hinder effective data collection. Consequently, this leads to an “N/A” classification, as accurate projections cannot be made.</p>
